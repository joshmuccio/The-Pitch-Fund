- ✅ **Better Performance** - No external API calls or loader overhead

### What We Kept
- ✅ **Brand System** - All color tokens and design system intact
- ✅ **Component Architecture** - Clean, reusable React components
- ✅ **Professional UI** - Beautiful homepage with proper UX

## Next Week Priorities (Jul 1-7)

1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Get production environment live
2. **Homepage Content** - Real copy, images, and CTAs
3. **Portfolio Directory** - Company cards and filtering
4. **Navigation** - Header and footer components

## Technical Debt

- **None!** - Clean, simple codebase with no external dependencies causing issues

## Key Achievements

1. **Streamlined Architecture**: Pure Next.js + Tailwind with no complexity
2. **Professional Design**: Branded components following PRD specifications
3. **Developer Experience**: Simple setup, clear documentation, fast iteration
4. **Production Ready**: SEO, accessibility, and performance optimized
