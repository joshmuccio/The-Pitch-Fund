# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Welcome to The Pitch Fund! This tutorial will get you up and running with the development environment in about 15 minutes.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- âœ… A fully functional local development environment
- âœ… The database connected and seeded with sample data
- âœ… The admin interface running locally
- âœ… Created your first test investment

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **Git** for version control
- **A Supabase account** (free tier is fine)
- **A code editor** (VS Code recommended)

---

## Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd "The Pitch Fund"

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

**Expected result:** You should see packages installing without errors.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Supabase

### Create Your Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Click "New Project" 
3. Choose a project name (e.g., "the-pitch-fund-dev")
4. Set a secure password and region
5. Wait for the database to initialize (~2 minutes)

### Install Supabase CLI

```bash
# macOS (recommended)
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# Verify installation
supabase --version
```

### Connect to Your Project

```bash
# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref-id
```

**ðŸ’¡ Find your project ref:** In your Supabase dashboard, go to Settings > General. The Project Reference ID is shown there.

---

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your Supabase credentials to `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Optional: Email subscriptions (can skip for now)
BEEHIIV_API_TOKEN=your-beehiiv-token
BEEHIIV_PUBLICATION_ID=your-publication-id
```

**ðŸ’¡ Find your keys:** In Supabase dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API

---

## Step 4: Set Up the Database

```bash
# Apply all database migrations
supabase db push

# Generate TypeScript types
supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/supabase.types.ts
```

**Expected result:** You should see "Finished supabase db push" with no errors.

---

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev
```

**Expected result:** The server starts on `http://localhost:3001` (or next available port).

---

## Step 6: Verify Everything Works

### Check the Homepage
1. Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser
2. You should see The Pitch Fund homepage with the newsletter signup

### Check the Admin Interface
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/admin`
2. You should see the login page
3. Sign up with your email to create an admin account

### Test Database Connection
1. After signing up, you should see the admin dashboard
2. Try clicking "Add New Investment" to verify forms are working

You now have The Pitch Fund running locally! Here's what you can do next:

### Immediate Next Steps
- **Create your first investment:** Follow [Creating Your First Investment](creating-first-investment.md)
- **Explore the admin interface:** Add test companies and founders
- **Check the database:** View your data in the Supabase dashboard

### When You're Ready to Go Deeper
- **Learn the architecture:** See [Architecture Overview](../explanation/architecture.md)
- **Understand the database:** Read [Database Design](../explanation/database-design.md)
- **Set up monitoring:** Check [Deployment Guide](../how-to/deployment.md)

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found: supabase"**
- Solution: Install Supabase CLI via Homebrew (not npm)

**"Connection refused" errors**
- Solution: Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct Supabase URL and keys

**Port conflicts**
- Solution: The dev server will automatically try ports 3001, 3002, etc.

**Database migration failures**
- Solution: Check [Database Management](../how-to/database-management.md) for detailed troubleshooting
