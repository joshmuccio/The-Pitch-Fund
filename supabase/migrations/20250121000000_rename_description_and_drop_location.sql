-- Migration: Rename description to description_ai_generated and drop location column
-- Date: 2025-01-21
-- Description: Rename 'description' column to 'description_ai_generated' for clarity (it stores vector embeddings)
--              and drop the redundant 'location' column as it's superseded by structured location fields

-- Drop any dependent views that might reference these columns
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS company_progress_timeline CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS founder_timeline_analysis CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS founder_insights CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS portfolio_demographics CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS company_investment_summary CASCADE;

-- Add helpful migration notes
/*
MIGRATION NOTES:

1. RENAMED COLUMN: description â†’ description_ai_generated
   - This column stores vector embeddings (vector(1536)) for AI features
   - The rename clarifies its purpose vs description_raw (user input)

2. DROPPED COLUMN: location
   - Redundant with structured location fields:
     * hq_address_line_1, hq_address_line_2
     * hq_city, hq_state, hq_zip_code, hq_country
     * hq_latitude, hq_longitude

3. UPDATED VIEWS: Recreated dependent views to ensure compatibility
   - Fixed founder name references to use first_name + last_name instead of deprecated name column

USAGE AFTER MIGRATION:
- Use description_raw for human-readable company descriptions
- Use description_ai_generated for vector/embedding operations
- Use structured hq_* fields for location queries
