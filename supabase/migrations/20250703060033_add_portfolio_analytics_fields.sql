-- Migration: Add Portfolio Analytics Fields
-- Adds demographic tracking, investment stage context, and podcast season mapping

-- ===== 1. NEW ENUMS =====

-- Founder demographic tracking
CREATE TYPE founder_sex AS ENUM ('male','female');

-- Company funding stage at time of our investment
CREATE TYPE company_stage AS ENUM (
  'pre_seed',
  'seed'
);

-- ===== 2. COMPANIES TABLE UPDATES =====

-- a) Country (ISO-3166-1 alpha-2) â€“ short, index-friendly
ALTER TABLE companies
ADD COLUMN country char(2) CHECK (country ~ '^[A-Z]{2}$');

-- b) Stage at the moment **we** invested
ALTER TABLE companies
ADD COLUMN stage_at_investment company_stage DEFAULT 'pre_seed';

-- c) Season number of the podcast episode the company debuted in
ALTER TABLE companies
ADD COLUMN pitch_season integer CHECK (pitch_season >= 1);

-- ===== 3. FOUNDERS TABLE UPDATE =====

-- Add demographic tracking field
ALTER TABLE founders
ADD COLUMN sex founder_sex;

-- ===== 4. PERFORMANCE INDEXES =====

-- Helpful index for filtering by season
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_pitch_season ON companies(pitch_season);

-- Optional index if querying by founder demographics
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_founders_sex ON founders(sex);

-- Compound index for common analytics queries (country + stage)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_companies_country_stage ON companies(country, stage_at_investment);

-- ===== 8. BEST PRACTICES COMPLIANCE =====

-- Update updated_at timestamp for modified tables
-- (Triggers already exist from previous migrations, so new columns will be included automatically)

-- Add validation examples in comments
/*
USAGE EXAMPLES:

1. Portfolio Analytics by Country:
   SELECT * FROM portfolio_demographics WHERE country = 'US';

2. Season Performance Tracking:
   SELECT * FROM season_performance ORDER BY success_rate_percentage DESC;

3. Diversity Analytics:
   SELECT 
     country,
     AVG(female_founder_percentage) as avg_female_representation
   FROM portfolio_demographics 
   GROUP BY country
   ORDER BY avg_female_representation DESC;

4. Investment Stage Analysis:
   SELECT 
     stage_at_investment,
     COUNT(*) as investments,
     AVG(post_money_valuation) as avg_valuation
   FROM companies 
   WHERE stage_at_investment IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY stage_at_investment;

5. Podcast Season ROI Analysis:
   SELECT 
     pitch_season,
     success_rate_percentage,
     avg_investment,
     avg_valuation
   FROM season_performance
   WHERE companies_invested >= 3; -- Seasons with meaningful sample size
