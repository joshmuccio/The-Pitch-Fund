-- Migration: Drop pitch_deck_url column from companies table
-- Date: 2025-01-06  
-- Description: Remove pitch_deck_url column as it's no longer needed in the form

-- PostgreSQL requires dropping views that depend on the column (even with SELECT c.*)
-- We'll immediately recreate them identically (just without the pitch_deck_url column)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS company_progress_timeline;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS founder_timeline_analysis;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS founder_insights;

-- Drop the pitch_deck_url column
ALTER TABLE companies DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS pitch_deck_url;

-- Recreate the views (identical to before, just without pitch_deck_url in c.*)
